      "These phones sound really nice, for being under $20. I have owned at least 30 different headphones since 1974, and these sound as good as any of the $100 Sennheisers I had back when Elton John's \"Rocket Man\" was new music. The power requirement for the voice coils in these phones is remarkably low: They sound great for listening to music on a cell phone or tablet, and you won't even have to crank the volume up to maximum. Some of the headphones I have owned recently don't work well with mobile devices, requiring more output power than the audio chip in a cell phone can provide - that won't be a problem with these Sony ZX-110 phones. They sound just fine on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S at 50% of max volume. Frequency response is very good for economy priced phones, with clear treble and adequate bass response to let you \"feel\" the drums and bass guitar. Soprano and contralto vocals sound nice and clear, without that \"muddy\" sound that cheap phones give that don't have enough high-frequency response. These phones fold up into a very small, compact footprint that is easy to store in a medium or large purse, or any briefcase, backpack, or laptop computer bag. The cord is 3 feet, and has a 90° angled plug. This cord length is great for use with a cell phone in a shirt pocket, although not really long enough for home use with a desktop computer. If you are going to use these phones to listen to music on a home stereo or desktop computer, you will need an extension cord, but these aren't terribly expensive.COMFORT: Sony got this right: these phones grip your head just firmly enough to stay in place, without squeezing you to death. I have had a couple of Sony phones that were horrible in this respect, with way too much compression on an average sized head; that's not a problem with these phones. The ear pads are very comfortable, and they don't press hard enough on your earlobes to make you need to take your earrings off to use the phones.SUMMARY: A Typical Sony economy-priced headphone with much better sound than you might have expected at this price point. Folds up very small for carrying in a purse or laptop computer bag, Very comfortable to wear for up to several hours.PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n",

That means 19 stocking holders, too, and I have all kinds of them. This year, we had problems with two fully-laden stocking holders falling down. One year one of them conked my mother-in-law in the forehead - and, no, it wasn't on purpose. Every year I go hunting for heavier sturdier stocking holders. The absolute prizes of my collection are the heavy brass stocking holders by Goods of the Woods. I have two of these snowmen, two Santas and two Christmas trees. These holders are beautiful, highly polished and finished. They are built for stability - note the long arm to hang the stocking on, versus the puny little hook most holders have. This longer and more-curved hook sets the filled-to-the-brim stocking below the holder instead of in front of it. This makes the burdened holder very stable. The stocking's weight is pulling the holder down against the shelf, instead of tipping the holder forward and off the shelf. Last, but not least, these holders are heavy in and of themselves. I LOVE these holders. If Goods of the Woods made five more designs (of which I could buy two each) I would use nothing but their stocking holders! If you hang up your stockings just for show, then you wouldn't need to splurge on these heavy brass ones. There's lots of good-looking stocking holders out there that will hold an empty stocking just fine. But if you actually fill up your stockings, I can highly recommend these super sturdy Goods of the Woods holders. (Note, Goods of the Woods does make some holders that are not as heavy.)\",\n",
